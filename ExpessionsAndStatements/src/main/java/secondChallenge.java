    The first method should be named displayHighScorePosition
    This method should have 2 parameters, one for a player's name, and one for
        a player's position on the high score list
    The method should print a message " Name managed to get into position 2 on
        the high score list."

    The second method should be named calculateHighScorePosition
    This method should have only 1 parameter, the player's score
    This method should return a number between 1 and 4, based on the score values
        show below

    Score >= 1000 = 1
    Score >= 500 but < 1000 = 2
    Score >= 100 but < 500 = 3
    All other scores = 4

    Finally, call both methods and display the results for the following scores:
    1500, 1000, 500, 100, and 25.
